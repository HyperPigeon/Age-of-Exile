WARNING. This is update is in BETA!

## v2.1.0

Added RIFTS!

Rifts are short, wave based activities where you try to kill mobs fast enough.
They spawn ocasionally in hell, near the player's current coordinates.
If you can't kill the mobs fast enough, they will explode and the rift will fail, 
which means no rewards at the end!
