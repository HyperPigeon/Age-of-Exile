#v3.0.0

This update finally brings Mine and Slash to 1.16.5 Forge!
I want to talk about the main changes that I'm excited about first.

# Gear system is entirely reworked.

From now on, gear no longer drops. But wait! Instead of gear dropping, what drops is a Soul.
That soul can be inserted into a piece of gear to give it stats. Kind of like socketing a gem in most other games.

What this means is:
- 99% of gear is now compatible by default!
- All gear is now useful, as you will always need new fresh gears for inserting souls into. 
- Vanilla progression actually matters, as you probably want gear with lots of durability, like that sweet netherite gear.
- It's much easier on me to develop, as I don't have to make new item models and icons.

I hope this can satisfy the whole playerbase as I know how much everyone hated dealing with gear compatibility issues! In case some gears aren't recognized like say a Hammer from some other mod. You can easily add compatibility with either config or datapack. You just need to specify item id, and what type of item it is. And as long as the mod knows the item is a Hammer, you can put any Hammer soul you find on it!

# Professions.

A long requested feature by players was consumable and gear crafting. So I thought, why not add both? 

This update adds 6 new professions:
- Alchemy
- Cooking
- Inscribing
- Jewel crafting
- Armor crafting
- Weapon crafting


The way it works is simple. Mobs can drop ingredients, and you can use them to craft things.
Not all ingredients can be used for all professions. So mix and match what you find to craft the things you need.
You can make potions, short but strong buffs. Foods, which are long lasting buffs. You can even craft gear with stats you want! Although beware, there is a chance of failure the more ingredients are used.

# The draggy clicky QOL

Ever had gear on low durability in the middle of an adventure? Or a gem dropped but you are away from your socketing station at home? No worries, I deleted both the repair, socketing and modify stations! Now you don't need them anymore, as you can just drag the item. Drag the gem to your gear and it's socketed! Drag the repair material to your broken armor piece and it's repaired!


# Other notable changes
- Runes now give no stats, and are instead used to craft runewords at the Runeword station. The station has a simplified interface with neat QOL features like telling you what runewords you can craft on which item type and whether you have the runes required for them.
- Spell school gui has been redesigned to be prettier and easier to use. Now you can setup your hotbar in the same gui where you pick spells!
- Casting improvements! You no longer need to press shift to cast spells! That is only required for the second hotbar now. (which you can fill with high cooldown buffs and ultimate spells)
- All items can now be socketed! Once. In my play tests, this made gems much more useful.
- gear stat requirements removed
- gear now comes in tiers, not levels. This means if you are killing mobs your tier, you will always get gear that you can wear right now. You can wear T1 gear at lvl 1, T2 gear at lvl 10 etc. The higher the gear rarity, the higher the effective level of the gear. 
This means getting a high rarity gear is key to progressing. No longer will you get a slightly higher level crappy gear to replace your legendary.
- less gear rarities, more meaningful differences. You will feel the change from each rarity. An epic gear has about 10 effective levels more than a common gear, making it that much stronger.
- talents have been temporarily removed due to design difficulties
- blocking now spends energy, and running stops energy regeneration.
