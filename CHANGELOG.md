## v1.8.0

* new overlay gui. I think this one will become the main one. 
Basically like hack slash mine's gui, just less textured.
It's fully configurable unlike the other guis.
* nerfed salvaging a bit
* increased mob hp
* nerfed ranged weapon base damage
* mob lvl is slower per distance now
* need bit more exp per lvl
* more hp, less regen (I hear there's too many one shot deaths, I want less of that)
* fix restoration to magic shield stat not working on spell effects
* added max wear cap for uniques and runeword gear back in (I had that in mine and slash but thought i could balance things perfectly this time, yeah that wasn't possible, everyone just wore runed gear)
* added new healer talents
* newbie gear drops now drop with much more durability
* newbie gear bag now costs much less
* jewelry should no longer drop as super high level when killing low level mobs. Same with all types of gear really but jewelry had the highest level variance and problem
* on high favor bosses and chests now drop extra loot but cost extra favor per item (think of it as faster to get loot, but with a higher favor cost)
if I'm correct, this will make it much harder to have too much favor but still rewarding enough so players don't resort to mob farms.
* player is now fully restored on level up
* added 2 items, empty and full favor bottle. Contains 1000 favor. 
Possible uses: modpacker way to give favor, players can save their favor if they don't want to spend it. etc.
* enabled keepinventory gamerule by default, instead of just hotbar and armor.
Reason: I upped difficulty, going back to spawn should be punishment enough.
 If not, you can disable it, or wait till I get an idea for a fair death peanlty in a mod where your gear is 90% of your strength.
* if item too high lvl, item is tried to put in inventory instead of dropping
* gear has more durability now
* added salvage bag item back in. 
Salvage bag now has a nifty feature, if you currently have a lower rarity gear equipped, it won't salvage that rarity or lower!
* buffed gear base defense values
* added death xp penalty back in (i accidentally disabled it)
* added repair hammers! Craftable with aoe gems like a pickaxe. These hammers when used repair all your gear by a certain amount!
* added level up reward bags
* added level up reward configs, works based on loot tables.
You lvl up, get the reward bag, click it, it gives you items based on the configured loot table.
This bag item can be used for more than level up rewards if modpackers wish.
* leveling now has milestone rewards! Get useful materials to progress as you level up!
* gem lvl req now higher, max tier is max lvl
* choose spell is now V, use spell is R hotkey. I think that's easier.
* added spell cast hotkey! Retained right click cast as a config
