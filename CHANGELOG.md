WARNING. This is update is in BETA!

## v2.0.10

TLDR: Divine missions feature, dungeon keys now drop from the missions, dying in them is also punished now.

I have labeled the build as RELEASE but it will be a bit misleading for those that followed the updates. I originally wanted to wait until I add some more content and put release on a build I feel is ready to have a very fun playthrough on. But I decided I need to label it as release right now because the v1.7.x version is getting very outdated. The v.2.0 was stable for a while too.

More talent icons by rosedragon!

fix auto salvage bag being able to salvage tools and unsalvagable items

nerfed pots a bit

fixed rose dragon's immobilizing effect damage effect

tweak core stat values

added favor penalty to deaths in dungeons, they are now very high risk, high reward.

added failure penalty for multiple deaths in dungeons, after x amount of deaths, the dungeon is cleared and you fail the expedition.

nerfed loot and xp from dungeons

reduced favor per chest opened because now you can earn it with missions.

added favor command

added spells to ingame wiki

populate chunks around player too. This means if you had beacons appearing before, now you might see them again but they should disappear and populate the dungeon correctly, even though a bit late.

Common dungeon keys are now a rare drop from mobs

Rarer dungeon keys can be gotten through Divine Missions.
